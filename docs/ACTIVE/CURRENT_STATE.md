---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 2.0 — Google OAuth + Admin
- Google OAuth login (PKCE flow via `@supabase/ssr`)
- Admin user management panel (`/admin/users`)
- Role assignment (Admin / Operation / Sales)
- Mock mode for local dev (env-var gated, never reaches prod)

### Phase 2.1 — Role-Based Dashboards
- Auto-detect role from auth, admin gets override dropdown
- Admin / Operation / Sales dashboards
- Negotiating lead status + clickable status pill

### Phase 2.2 — Mobile Trello Cards
- Trello-style single-scroll mobile card (all 3 entity types)
- Sticky comment composer with `100dvh` fix
- "Log activity" label above composer

### Phase 2.3 — @Mentions & In-App Notifications
- `@mention` autocomplete in note textarea (desktop)
- In-app notification bell (sidebar) with unread badge
- Click notification → navigate to entity + mark read
- Reply on notes (inline box pre-filled with `@author`)
- Delete notes (confirm dialog + optimistic update + rollback)
- History restyle: content-first bubbles, subtext metadata
- Activity log saves actual user text (not `[Note]` placeholder)
- Activity author = signed-in user (not card owner)
- Team/owner dropdowns driven by real Supabase users

---

### Phase 2.4 — Web Push PWA + Persisted Notifications ✅
- `notifications` + `push_subscriptions` tables in Supabase (with RLS)
- Notifications persist to DB + load on login (no longer lost on reload)
- Bell syncs across devices: Supabase Realtime + 20s visible-poll + foreground refetch
- Activity feed syncs across devices (same three-layer mechanism)
- Installable PWA (`manifest.json` + service worker + icons)
- Web Push via `web-push` + VAPID — delivers even when tab closed
- iOS-compatible: permission requested via user-gesture button in sidebar banner
- "Send test notification" self-test button (verified working end-to-end)

**Deferred → Phase 2.4b (Email):** Resend email blocked on DNS — `sixsheet.co`
is on Wix (no subdomain MX support) and `sixsheet.me` is reserved for API/payments.
Resolve later with a non-Wix DNS domain (e.g. `crm.sixsheet.me`). Web Push covers
the mobile-alert need in the meantime, so email is low priority.

## 🎨 Phase 2.5 — UI/UX Design System Refresh ✅ (Complete — June 17, 2026)

**Goal:** Establish a consistent visual design language across all screens — desktop and mobile — so the app feels professional, readable, and easy to use.

**Shipped:**
- **2.5.1 Design tokens** — type scale + `.field-label`/`.field-value`/`.field-placeholder` + `.edit-affordance` (44px tap target) in `app/globals.css`.
- **2.5.2 Card headers** — Won detail header stacks responsively on mobile; breadcrumb duplication bug fixed (`formatJobMeta` = clean "type · category", no empty `—` segments); Leads/Customers headers already responsive.
- **2.5.3 Field & edit UI** — all detail-card labels migrated to `.field-label`; Customers edit pencil `<span>`→`<button>` (keyboard-focusable).
- **2.5.4 Button system** — 4 types (Primary/Secondary/Ghost/Destructive); added `success` variant; Won/Lost + dialogs + inline Reply/Delete all on-system.
- **2.5.5 Mobile audit** — Leads & Customers stacked card lists at 375px; notification dropdown rebuilt on portal Popover (no clipping); drag-drop file attach on mobile composer; `฿` glyph spacing.

### Issues to Fix (from design audit)

| Area | Problem | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Typography** | No clear scale — title, label, value, caption all feel ad-hoc | Define 5-level type scale, apply everywhere |
| **Field hierarchy** | Labels and values same weight — hard to scan | Labels muted/small, values bold/dark |
| **Subtitle/breadcrumb** | Wall of dashes, duplicated text bug | Shorten to meaningful info, fix duplication |
| **Edit touch targets** | Pencil icons ~16px — too small on mobile | Minimum 44px tap area on all edit controls |
| **Button system** | Log, Attach, Reply, Delete — all different sizes/styles | Define 4 button types: Primary / Secondary / Ghost / Destructive |
| **Color tokens** | `text-primary`, `text-muted`, `text-placeholder` used inconsistently | Standardize semantic color tokens across all components |
| **Section headers** | Blue A / Green B — decorative but no consistent meaning | Review color coding system, document the pattern |
| **Card header layout** | ID chip, date, title, subtitle, icons, value, dropdown — too crowded | Restructure into clear hierarchy zones |
| **Spacing density** | Field rows packed unevenly | Standardize: 48px row height, 16px section padding, 12px field gap |
| **Value display** | "Value" label disconnected from number top-right | Integrate into card header cleanly |
| **Placeholder text** | Colour too close to real values in some fields | Use consistent `text-muted-foreground` token |
| **Mobile consistency** | Some components untested at 375px after desktop changes | Full mobile audit pass on all 3 entity types |

### Scope by Component

#### 2.5.1 — Design Tokens
- Finalize type scale: `text-2xl` Title / `text-base` Body / `text-sm` Label / `text-xs` Caption
- Semantic color aliases: `text-field-label`, `text-field-value`, `text-placeholder`
- Standardize spacing scale in Tailwind config

#### 2.5.2 — Card Header Redesign
- Clean 2-row structure: [ID + date chip] / [Title large] / [Owner + Value inline right]
- Remove clutter from single row
- Fix breadcrumb duplication bug

#### 2.5.3 — Field & Edit UI
- Label: `text-xs font-medium text-muted-foreground uppercase tracking-wide`
- Value: `text-sm font-medium text-foreground`
- Edit pencil: wrapped in 44px tap target, visible on hover (desktop) / always visible (mobile)

#### 2.5.4 — Button System
- **Primary:** filled, brand color — Log, Save, Confirm
- **Secondary:** outline — Attach, Cancel
- **Ghost:** text only — Reply, Edit
- **Destructive:** red text or filled red — Delete

#### 2.5.5 — Mobile Audit
- All 3 card types (Customer, Lead, Won) at 375px
- Touch targets ≥ 44px verified
- No horizontal scroll
- Sticky composer remains above browser chrome (`100dvh`)

### Estimated Effort
| Task | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Design token audit + Tailwind config | 2h |
| Card header redesign | 2h |
| Field + edit UI standardisation | 3h |
| Button system unification | 2h |
| Mobile audit + fixes | 2h |
| **Total** | **~11h** |

**Risk:** Low — CSS/styling only, no logic or data changes.  
**Deploy:** One Friday release.

## 📋 Phase 2.6 — Won Board Mobile Parity (Planned)

**Goal:** Make the Won & Ready for OP board behave the same on mobile as on
desktop — **stages arranged horizontally** (swipe left/right between stages),
**cards stacked vertically** inside each stage. Today mobile stacks stages
vertically (`flex-col sm:flex-row`), so the board reads as one long vertical
list instead of a Trello-style horizontal board.

### Scope
- **Layout flip (small):** board container `flex flex-col sm:flex-row` →
  `flex flex-row` (always horizontal); give columns a swipeable mobile width
  (e.g. `w-[80vw] min-w-[80vw] sm:min-w-[240px] sm:max-w-[240px]`); ensure
  `min-w-max` + horizontal scroll apply on mobile. `app/won-ready-op/page.tsx`
  ~lines 319, 1318–1320. Cards already use `verticalListSortingStrategy` — no change.
- **Touch-gesture handling (the real work / main risk):** the whole column is
  currently a drag handle (`cursor-grab` + dnd listeners on the wrapper, line
  319–321). On a horizontal-scrolling mobile board this collides with native
  swipe-to-scroll between stages and with card drags. Needs a **dedicated drag
  handle** on mobile and/or dnd-kit touch-sensor activation constraints
  (press-delay + distance) so scroll vs. drag are distinguishable.
- **Vertical overflow per column:** confirm a tall stage scrolls cleanly inside
  its column at 375px without breaking the board's horizontal scroll.

### Notes
- Deliberately revisits the Phase 2.2 "mobile single-scroll" decision for this board only — Details/Activity drawers keep their current mobile layout.
- **Risk:** Medium — the CSS flip is trivial; the dnd/touch gesture disambiguation is where the effort and regression risk live. Test drag-reorder of stages, drag-move of cards between stages, and horizontal/vertical scroll all on a real touch device at 375px.

## ⏰ Phase 2.7 — Won Card Due Date + Scheduled Push (Planned)

**Goal:** Add a Due date (date **+ time**) to Won cards. When the due datetime
arrives, send a push notification (and in-app notification) to the users
involved with that card.

### Reuses (already built — Phase 2.4)
- Web Push send pipeline: `app/api/push/send/route.ts` (`recipientId` → `push_subscriptions` → web-push/VAPID).
- In-app notifications: `notifications` table + the `notifyMentions()` pattern in `store/crm-store.ts` (creates notification + fires push together) — the due-date notifier mirrors this.
- User→subscription mapping via `users` table / `TeamMember.id`.

### New work
- **Data:** add `due_at TIMESTAMPTZ` + `due_notified_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to the Won jobs table + `WonJob` type. (`event_date` is date-only; `event_time` is a free string — neither is a real datetime.)
- **UI:** date + time picker on the Won detail card (per the requirement mockup) with inline-edit save.
- **Scheduler (the crux — nothing scheduled exists today):** `app/api/cron/check-due-jobs` that runs every few minutes, selects jobs where `due_at <= now()` AND `due_notified_at IS NULL`, sends push + in-app notification to involved users, then stamps `due_notified_at` (dedup).
- **Involved-users resolution:** map `owner` (a name string) → `TeamMember.id`; `staff_list` are gig workers (no login/push). May need a new `assignee_ids TEXT[]` field to notify more than the owner.

### Open decisions (resolve before building)
1. **Who is "involved"?** Owner only, or add an explicit `assignee_ids` field? (Staff cannot receive push.)
2. **Timing:** fire exactly at `due_at`, or support a lead-time reminder (e.g. 1h / 1 day before)?
3. **Scheduler choice:** Vercel **Hobby crons run only once/day** — insufficient for time-precise alerts. Needs **Vercel Pro** (per-minute cron) OR Supabase `pg_cron` OR an external trigger. This decides feasibility/accuracy.
4. **Timezone:** store `due_at` as UTC timestamptz; ensure the picker and cron comparison agree on the user's timezone.

**Risk:** Medium-High — the scheduler is net-new infrastructure with an external dependency (Vercel plan / pg_cron) and a dedup requirement; push delivery itself is already proven.

## 🗄️ Phase 2.8 — Move Attachments to Supabase Storage (Planned)

**Goal:** Stop storing file attachments as base64 inside `activities.attachments`
(JSONB) and move the bytes to a Supabase **Storage** bucket, keeping only a
small reference (path / filename / size / type) in the row. This is the durable
fix for the egress overage (19 GB against a 5 GB cap, June 2026).

### Why
Files-as-base64 means file bytes (≈+33% over binary) travel through DB egress on
every activity query. A stop-gap already shipped (commit `9669186`): the frequent
refresh fetches metadata only (`getAllLite`) and the poll was slowed 20s→60s — but
startup (`initializeData`) still pulls all base64 once per session, and the design
is inherently egress-heavy. Storage fixes it permanently: list queries stay tiny;
files download on demand as binary, only when opened.

### Scope
- **Storage bucket** (e.g. `activity-attachments`) with RLS; signed or public URLs as appropriate.
- **Upload path:** on attach, upload the file to Storage; store `{ path, filename, size, type }` in `activities.attachments` instead of `{ data: base64 }`.
- **Render path:** activity feed shows filename/size + a thumbnail/download that fetches from Storage on click (not inline base64).
- **Migration:** one-off script to move existing base64 attachments into the bucket and rewrite rows to references. Keep a fallback render for any legacy base64 rows until migrated.
- **Cleanup:** delete the Storage object when a note/attachment is deleted.

### Notes
- Revisit `initializeData` so it no longer needs `select('*')` with blobs (use `getAllLite` everywhere; attachments load per-open-record).
- Storage has its own egress, but on-demand + binary is far cheaper than base64-on-every-poll.

**Risk:** Medium — touches upload, render, delete, plus a data migration of existing attachments. Worth a branch + careful test of attach/view/delete and the legacy fallback.

## 🌗 Phase 2.9 — Dark Theme (Planned)

**Goal:** A working, complete dark mode across every screen.

**Current state:** A `theme-provider` (`components/layout/theme-provider.tsx`) and a
"Switch to dark mode" toggle already exist, and CSS color tokens support both
modes — but only ~13 files use `dark:` classes. Most screens were built with
hardcoded light colors (`text-slate-800`, `bg-white`, `bg-rose-50`, etc.), so
toggling dark today leaves large parts of the UI broken or unreadable.

### Scope
- Audit every screen (dashboards, customers, leads, won board + detail drawers, admin, login).
- Replace hardcoded colors with semantic tokens / add `dark:` variants; lean on the design-token vars from Phase 2.5.
- Verify both modes at 375px and desktop; ensure the toggle persists the preference.

**Risk:** Low-medium — CSS only, but broad (touches nearly every component).

## 👤 Phase 3.0 — Admin: Manage + Delete Users (Planned)

**Goal:** Let an admin remove a user, not just change their role.

**Current state:** `app/admin/users/page.tsx` can change a user's role; there is
**no delete**.

### Scope
- Add delete-user (admin-only) with a confirmation dialog showing impact.
- Guards: can't delete yourself; can't remove the last admin.
- Remove the Supabase auth user + `users` row; decide handling of their assigned leads/jobs/notifications (reassign vs. leave with orphaned owner name).

**Risk:** Medium — destructive + touches auth; must follow the deletion rules (confirm, clear impact).

---

## 🧹 Phase 3.1 — Admin: Delete Staff from Registry (Planned)

**Goal:** Let an admin delete a staff member (จ่ายเงินน้องออกงาน) from the registry.

**Current state:** Staff live in the `staff_members` table; the Won board only
**un-assigns** staff from a job (`removeStaff`) — it can't delete from the registry.
A `staffQueries.delete` may need adding.

### Scope
- Admin-only "delete staff" action (likely a manage-staff view) with confirmation.
- Handle staff already referenced in jobs' `staff_list`: leave the per-job snapshot intact (incl. fee_thb), just remove from the pickable registry.

**Risk:** Low-medium — destructive but isolated; admin-gated.

**Note:** 3.0 and 3.1 are both admin-gated destructive actions — both need a role check + the standard confirm-dialog / clear-impact deletion pattern.

---

## 🚨 Known Issues

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Email notifications not sent — deferred to Phase 2.4b (blocked on non-Wix DNS domain)
- [ ] Mobile @mention autocomplete — mobile composer uses plain `<input>`, not `MentionTextarea`
- [ ] `activity_id` column name — verify Supabase `activities` table uses `activity_id` not `id` before delete is exercised in prod

### Resolved (Phase 2.4)
- [x] Notifications now persist to Supabase (survive reload)
- [x] Bell + activity feed sync across devices (Realtime + poll + foreground)
- [x] Web Push delivers to mobile (verified end-to-end on iOS)
